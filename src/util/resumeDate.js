  About:
    "I am a BSc graduate with software Engineering from Addis Ababa University. While in my campus, I worked for many hours with my best team members to work hard and get experience with software development. I learned about who to develop softwareâ€™s, web development and android application development from beginning to result. Being the part of the process made me realize how much I love the software engineering. What ever be the situation and time I never tired of doing my software projects like web development and android app developments. During those years, I realize that this is what I went to do my whole life, not just as a helper but as a professional. \n\nOnce my mind was set, I started seeing the entire process in a different light. Even my teachers think that am a natural at it.my educational mind set is simple: stability and function. I have the determination to study comprehensively, and I hate shortcuts. A trait that has given me a vast knowledge spectrum. I have even enrolled in my class that given me a crossover of software development significant and comprehensive view of how things are done.
